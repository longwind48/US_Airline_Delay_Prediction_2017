This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

This markdown file is a summary of a final project 

```{r include=FALSE}
setwd("C:/Users/longwind48/Google Drive/Programming/Projects/us_airline_delay_prediction")
source("scripts/mainForAnalysis.R")
```

```{r echo=TRUE}
head(dataForAnalysisOfCausesOfDelay)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
analyzeCausesOfDelay(dataForAnalysisOfCausesOfDelay)
```



Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
